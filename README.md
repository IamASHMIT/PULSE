Blood donation is a critical aspect of healthcare, ensuring the availability of blood for patients in need due to surgeries, accidents, or medical conditions like anemia and leukemia. However, managing blood donations efficiently is often challenging due to lack of coordination between donors, recipients, and blood banks. PLUSE aims to address these challenges by providing a structured digital platform for blood donation management.

Existing Challenges in Blood Donation Systems
Lack of Real-time Data: Many hospitals and blood banks struggle with outdated or incomplete donor records, leading to shortages or wastage of blood units.
Donor-Recipient Mismatch: Difficulty in matching donors with compatible recipients due to inadequate tracking systems.
Inefficient Communication: Blood banks, hospitals, and donors often rely on phone calls or manual records, which are slow and error-prone.
Emergency Situations: In critical cases, finding a compatible donor quickly can be life-saving, but current systems do not always facilitate rapid donor identification.
Donor Engagement & Retention: Many willing donors do not donate regularly due to lack of reminders or incentives.
Proposed Solution: PLUSE Blood Donation Program
PLUSE is a digital platform designed to enhance the blood donation process by integrating donors, recipients, hospitals, and blood banks into a centralized database with real-time tracking.

Donor Registration & Tracking:

Donors can register, update their availability, and get notified when their blood type is in demand.
The system maintains donor history, tracking last donation date to ensure compliance with donation frequency guidelines.
Recipient Request System:

Hospitals and patients can submit requests for blood, specifying type, urgency, and location.
The system automatically searches for compatible donors and available blood banks.
Blood Bank Management:

Blood banks can update inventory status in real-time, reducing the risk of shortages or excess stock.
The system ensures proper storage and expiration tracking of blood units.
Emergency Alerts & Notifications:

Urgent donation requests trigger notifications to nearby eligible donors.
Hospitals and blood banks receive instant updates on available donors and inventory.
Data Analytics & Reports:

The platform generates reports on donation trends, demand patterns, and donor retention rates.
Helps healthcare organizations plan blood donation drives effectively.
By addressing these challenges, PLUSE ensures better accessibility, faster response times, and improved coordination in blood donationÂ management.
